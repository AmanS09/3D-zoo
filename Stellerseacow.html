                <h2>Steller Sea Cow</h2>
            <p>
                Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) was a massive, herbivorous marine mammal that lived in the North Pacific Ocean during the Pleistocene epoch. It was the largest sirenian ever known, growing up to 30 feet long and weighing up to 10 tons. Steller's sea cows were slow-moving and had a thick layer of blubber, which made them easy targets for hunters.

                Steller's sea cows were first discovered in 1741 by the German naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller, who was part of an expedition led by Vitus Bering. Steller's sea cows were hunted extensively by fur traders and other European settlers, and they were driven to extinction within just 27 years of their discovery.
                
                Steller's sea cows played an important role in the marine ecosystem. They grazed on kelp forests, which helped to keep the kelp healthy and productive. Kelp forests are important habitats for many other marine organisms, including fish, invertebrates, and seabirds.
                
                Here is a single paragraph summary of the main points about Steller's sea cows:

                Steller's sea cows are a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of protecting our planet'sÂ biodiversity.            </p>
