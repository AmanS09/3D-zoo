# EcoHolo Virtual ZOO

3D implementation of existing and extinct species of flora and fauna to depict complex ecosystems from various parts of the world. 
The virtual zoo could be displayed in schools, museums, and Ministries without using much physical space. The zoo could also hold educational sessions about the environment within the 
virtual space using pre-recorded videos of teachers from around the world.

## Features

**Interactive user interface: The user interface should be easy to use and allow users to navigate through the zoo with ease. It could include features such as a map, a list of animals, and search bar.

**3D animal models: The animal models should be realistic and detailed. They could be created using 3D modeling software or scanned from real animals.

**Animal information: Each animal should have a page with information about it, such as its species, habitat, and diet.

**Animal animations: The animals could be animated to move around and interact with each other. This would make the zoo more immersive and engaging for users.

**Educational games and activities: The zoo could include educational games and activities to teach users about animals and their habitats. This could help to make the zoo more educational and fun for children.
